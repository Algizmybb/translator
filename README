I18nExtensions
==============

I18n Extensions make using the internationalization (i18n) facility introduced in Rails 2.2 simpler by keeping your code DRY.

Example
=======

By sticking to a convention of locale key hierarchy like:

en:
  posts: # controller
    index: # action
      title: "My Blog Posts"
    show:
      byline: "Written by {{name}}"
