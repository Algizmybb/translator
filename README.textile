h2. Translator - i18n tooling for Rails

Translator make using the internationalization (i18n) facility introduced in Rails 2.2 simpler by keeping your code DRY.

h3. Example

By sticking to a convention of locale key hierarchy like:

<pre>
<code>
en:
  posts: # controller
    index: # action
      title: "My Blog Posts"
    show:
      byline: "Written by {{name}}"
</code>
</pre>

calls in controllers and views become @t('title')@ and the context is inferred.

h3. Benefits

Simple @translate@ (or @t@) method added to:

* ActionController
* ActionView
* ActionMailer
* ActiveRecord (coming soon)
* Test Helper (coming soon)
