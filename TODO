List of things todo:

- Confirm translate works for strings in layouts work

- Confirm that translate works for strings in helpers

- Add methods to ActiveRecord

- Strict mode? Catch accidental requests that would return hash of keys instead of string (usually unintended?)

- Split up different parts into diff. tests / code for each part of MVC & mailers

- How to make testing simpler?

- Pseudo-translating tool. If enabled, override default behavior to:
-- raise exception on missing translation
-- prepend/append markers to confirm that strings are externalized
