List of things TODO

- Confirm works with Rails 2.3

Features Ideas
- Enable a fallback mode, so instead of putting Missing Translation messages, fallback to English (or other locale)

Testing

- More readable translation assertion like: assert_match_translation full-key, text, error_msg

- Pseudo-translating tool. If enabled, override default behavior to:
-- raise exception on missing translation
-- prepend/append markers to confirm that strings are externalized

- rake task to find missing keys (started on branch)

Refactor
- Split up different parts into diff. tests / code for each part of MVC & mailers
